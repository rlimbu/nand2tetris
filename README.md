# nand2tetris
This repo has my [nand2tetris](www.nand2tetris.org) project. 

I have completed this project up to the construction of the hardware platform twice before, and even implemented the hardware in [logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). This time, I will be going all the way to the end, creating a Tetris game written in a programming language called Jack, which I will be implementing as part of this project!
