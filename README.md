# nand2tetris
This repo has my [nand2tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org) project. 

I have completed this project up to the construction of a von Neumann computer hardware platform twice before, and even implemented the hardware in [logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). This time, I will be going all the way to the end, implementing a virtual machine, a programming language called Jack, and an operating system. I might even write a neural network in Jack!
